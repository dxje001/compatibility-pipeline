# IPIP-50 Question to OCEAN Dimension Mapping
# =============================================================================
# This file maps each of the 50 IPIP questions to their corresponding
# Big Five (OCEAN) personality dimension.
#
# OCEAN Dimensions:
#   O - Openness to Experience
#   C - Conscientiousness
#   E - Extraversion
#   A - Agreeableness
#   N - Neuroticism (sometimes called Emotional Stability when reversed)
#
# Standard IPIP-50 uses columns named EXT1-EXT10, EST1-EST10, AGR1-AGR10,
# CSN1-CSN10, OPN1-OPN10. Adjust column names below to match your dataset.
#
# Each dimension has 10 items, with some reverse-scored.
# Reverse scoring: new_value = (max_scale + 1) - original_value
# For Likert scale 1-5: reversed = 6 - original
